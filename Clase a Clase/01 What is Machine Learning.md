# 01 What is Machine Learning

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. In an abstract task, we need to provide the machine with some experience related to that task, and a metric to measure its ability to perform the task based on the experience.

### Learning Paradigms

In general, there are three principal paradigms in Machine Learning: 
- Supervised learning: Use labels in data, usefull in, for example, classification problems. 
- Unsupervised learning: Do not use labels in data, useful in, for example, to find structures in data and anomalies.
- Reinforced learning: The algorithm must perform a certain goal. It doesnâ€™t know how
close to its goal is.
